I will update these references as the course progresses with additional resources that you might find helpful. Please let me know if there's anything you'd like me to include!

### Textbooks

I do not require that you have a physical textbook for this class. However, we will draw heavily from [The Art of Multiprocessor Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Multiprocessor-Programming-Revised-Reprint/dp/0123973376).

The [university library](https://library.ucsc.edu/) has online copies [available](https://ucsc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CDL_SCR_INST/epaiir/alma991025069492304876
).
